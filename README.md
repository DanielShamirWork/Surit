# Surit

Surit (from the Hungarian sűrít, meaning "to condense" or "to compress") is a compression library written in C++.

# About the Project

This is a student project created to explore the fundamentals of data compression algorithms and low-level programming. It is built from scratch for educational purposes, prioritizing code clarity and conceptual understanding.

# What's Inside

The library is currently in early development. It will serve as a playground for implementing classic lossless compression techniques, including:

    Run-Length Encoding (RLE)

    Huffman Coding

The goal is to provide a clean, readable C++ codebase that demonstrates exactly how raw data is analyzed, packed, and restored.
